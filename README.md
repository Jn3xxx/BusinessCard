# BusinessCard
A modular business card template application with light and dark mode enabled

This is a project I created to help with learning SwiftUI. 

Business card is coded 100% in SwiftUI and a fully modular static business card. It can be used as a standalone business card application
or added in as an "About Me" kind of page in your current application. 

Modifying is simple and I have left instructions in comments in places that need to be modified.
